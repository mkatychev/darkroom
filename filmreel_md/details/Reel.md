* Not all of a Reel's frames need to target the same object referenced by a
final frame's return body (or even the same object type).

* A successful state transition caused by the execution of a frame, however,
should directly impact the success of an object's complete state transition.
(rephrase this?)

* Ex: To test the successful ownership of "Product A"  by the "User" object, one
must first create a "Product" object with name of "A". (does this need a
diagram?)
